A revised government-industry council devoted to critical infrastructure protection could be set up to have broader and more specific discussions on things like cybersecurity and threats to hardware and software that monitor and control industrial processes, known as operational technology (OT). A top official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Nick Andersen, said Tuesday he couldn’t share a timeline yet for the replacement of the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council, which the Homeland Security Department disbanded to private sector dismay last year.

Executive Summary Insikt Group has identified a major cybercriminal operation specializing in large-scale cryptocurrency theft, operating under the moniker “Rublevka Team”. Since its inception in 2023, the threat group has generated over $10 million through affiliate-driven wallet draining campaigns. Rublevka Team is an example of a “traffer team,” composed of a network of thousands of social engineering specialists tasked with directing victim traffic to malicious pages. Unlike traditional malware-based approaches such as those used by the traffer teams Marko Polo and CrazyEvil (previously identified by Insikt Group, both of which distributed infostealer malware), Rublevka Team deploys custom JavaScript scripts via spoofed landing pages that impersonate legitimate crypto services, tricking victims into connecting their wallets and authorizing fraudulen", "topic": "ransomware", "time": 1770749781}, {"title": "CISA tells agencies to stop using unsupported edge devices", "text": "A binding operational directive issued Thursday looks to combat an attack pathway that has been behind some of the biggest attacks and most common exploits in recent years.

A Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency order published Thursday directs federal agencies to stop using “edge devices” like firewalls and routers that their manufacturers no longer support.

To implement effective cybersecurity programs and keep the security team deeply integrated into all business processes, the CISO needs to regularly demonstrate the value of this work to senior management. This requires speaking the language of business , but a dangerous trap awaits those who try. Security professionals and executives often use the same words, but for entirely different things. Sometimes, a number of similar terms are used interchangeably. As a result, top management may not understand which threats the security team is trying to mitigate, what the company’s actual level of cyber-resilience is, or where budget and resources are being allocated. Therefore, before presenting sleek dashboards or calculating the ROI of security programs, it’s worth subtly clarifying these important terminological nuances.
